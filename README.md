# Sparse Diffusion Models for LArTPC data
We are a team that is exploring the use of diffusion models for the generation of neutrino events in 3D LArTPC data. To make the problem of training tractable in high-resolution volumes typically encountered in LArTPC data (> 512^3) we propose an approach of combining sparse submanifold convolutions with diffusion. Furthermore, we use hierarchical training letting us scale the model to the high fidelity encountered in this data.
